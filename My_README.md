My Notes
==========

* To launch the executable that gives a demonstration of main function, just run:

    make clean; make;  ./test




* Interesting stuffs:
    * The cJSON structure
    * See how is allocated the memory
        * Apparently possible to precise allocators / de-allocators
        * For the free, just free the root cJSON structure
    * See the read part (fseek, ftell...)
